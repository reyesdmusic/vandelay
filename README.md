## About

This application allows a user to view Warehouse and Factory data along with either Inventory or Machine data. A user can easily toggle between factory and warehouse modes via links in the nav bar.

All data is displayed in grids and is searchable as well as paginated.

Within a given Factory or Warehouse detail, users can Add, Edit, and Delete existing Inventory Items or Machines.

After every action, a snackbar appears.

On mobile and other smaller screens, only a list of either Warehouses or Factories appears. Once a warehouse or factory is selected, its corresponding details and inventory or machine data slides in.
